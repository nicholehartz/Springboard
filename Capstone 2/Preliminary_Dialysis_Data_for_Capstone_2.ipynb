    "### Star Rating Explained\n",

    "Serum phosphorus is measured in milligrams of phosphorus per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). According to Mayo Medical Laboratories, a normal range for adults is generally 2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL. The normal range varies slightly depending on your age.\n",
    "Most commonly, a high level of phosphorus is related to a kidney disorder. It shows that your kidneys are having difficulty clearing phosphorus from your blood. A high level of phosphorus can also mean uncontrolled diabetes and other endocrine disorders."

It identifies the effective removal of a specific solute (clearance K) resulting from a given treatment (characterized by time t) in a given patient (with a specific volume of distribution V for the solute considered)."

    "A normal serum calcium level is 8-10 mg/dL (2-2.5 mmol/L) with some interlaboratory variation in the reference range, and hypercalcemia is defined as a serum calcium level greater than 10.5 mg/dL (>2.5 mmol/L)."

    "### AV fistula\n",
    "The best type of long-term access is an AV fistula. A surgeon connects an artery to a vein, usually in your arm, to create an AV fistula. An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away from your heart. A vein is a blood vessel that carries blood back toward your heart. When the surgeon connects an artery to a vein, the vein grows wider and thicker, making it easier to place the needles for dialysis. The AV fistula also has a large diameter that allows your blood to flow out and back into your body quickly. The goal is to allow high blood flow so that the largest amount of blood can pass through the dialyzer."

    "The nPCR is reported in grams of urea nitrogen per kilogram per day.\n",
    "Most guidelines specify maintaining the protein intake above 1.0 – 1.2 g/kg/day in dialysis patients, with values less than 0.8 g/kg/day being equated with malnutrition."

    "The Standardized Waitlist Ratio (SWR) measure tracks the number of incident patients at the dialysis facility under the age of 75 listed on the kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant waitlist or who received a living donor transplant within the first year of initiating dialysis. SWR is calculated to compare the observed waitlisting rate in the facility to the waitlisting rate that was expected. "

    "Also might be interesting to compare patient health indicators to a center's profit/ non-profit status or whether or not it's a chain buisness. \n",
